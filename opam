synopsis: "Proofs of Quicksort's worst- and average-case complexity in Coq"
description: """
The development contains:
- a set of monads and monad transformers for measuring a (possibly nondeterministic) algorithm's use of designated operations;
- monadically expressed deterministic and nondeterministic implementations of Quicksort;
- proofs of these implementations' worst- and average case complexity.
